# Fresh-vs.-Rotten-Fruit-Classification
This project uses machine learning and computer vision techniques to classify images of fruit as either fresh or rotten. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled fruit images and aims to help automate food quality control processes in agriculture, retail, and supply chain settings.

## üìå Project Overview

- Binary classification: Fresh vs. Rotten
- Built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)
- Suitable for agricultural automation, food supply chain monitoring, or smart grocery systems

## üß† Model Features

- CNN-based architecture for image classification
- Image preprocessing and real-time data augmentation
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
- Supports prediction on new, unseen images

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images of fruits categorized into "fresh" and "rotten" classes.  
*(Include the source or link to the dataset if available, e.g., Kaggle, Roboflow, or custom-collected.)*

Example classes:
- Fresh Apple
- Rotten Apple
- Fresh Banana
- Rotten Banana
- etc.

# Setup
1. Install the required packages:
```bash
